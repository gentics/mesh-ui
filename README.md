2. `$ git checkout develop`
3. `$ npm ci`
4. `$ npm start`
5. Download and run the Mesh Demo: https://getmesh.io/download/ OR you can run `npm run mesh` if you have docker installed.
6. Open `http://localhost:4200` in a browser.

# Testing

```
$ npm test
```

# Developer Notes

## Code Formatting

This project uses [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format the TypeScript code,
and [js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify) to format the HTML templates.

Formatting is performed automatically with every commit (by means of [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)). This means that
only well-formatted code should ever make it into the repo. In the event that there is a TSLint failure which cannot be automatically
fixed, the commit will fail with an error message from TSLint explaining what needs to be fixed manually.


## Strict null checks and the `!` operator

This project makes use of TypeScript's `strictNullChecks`. In general, we should avoid the use of the `!` non-null
assertion operator and try to make better use of correct typings, type guards and defensive programming.

This is not a hard rule and there are the following valid exceptions:

* Certain JavaScript patterns are not easy to express without falling back on `!`, for example when working with JavaScript Maps
 (See this discussion: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/9619). So we do not ban its use, but
it should be a last resort.
* In spec files we are less strict, since we are often purposefully constructing partial mock objects or creating
non-null states explicitly, so `!` is okay in specs in general if they cannot be easily avoided.
* There is a class of incorrectly-defined optional properties of the Mesh models generated by the RAML, e.g. `node.project.name`. Such
properties force the use of `!` until the RAML definitions are fixed. See https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/402
Once the Mesh interfaces have been fixed, that class of `!` operators can be removed.

# Distribution

In order to build the bundled static files for a web server to be served:

0. Optionally: Edit the base path in /src/app/index.html at ```<base href="/">``` to your need. E. g. ```<base href="/cms">```
1. ```$ npm run build```
2. At /dist are the files ready to be served.
